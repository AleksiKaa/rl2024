    "In many real world scenarios, the dimensionality of the state space may be too high to compute and store the Q-values for each possible state and action in a Q-table. Instead, the state value and action value functions can be learned by using a function approximator, such as a radial basis functions (RBFs). In this exercise, you will start with handcrafted features and then move to radial basis functions in the **Cartpole** environment.\n",

    "A radial basis function (RBF) is a real-valued function $\\phi$ that maps a vector $\\boldsymbol{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$ into a real-value $\\phi : \\mathbb{R}^d \\mapsto \\mathbb{R}$. The RBF $\\phi(\\boldsymbol{x} )$ = $\\phi(||\\boldsymbol{x} ||)$ acts on a distance (radial) and a basis function $\\phi$ (e.g. Gaussian function). The RBFs are commonly used as kernels in machine learning. The RBF kernel is defined as a $K(\\boldsymbol{x} , \\boldsymbol{x} ′) = 〈\\phi(\\boldsymbol{x}),\\phi(\\boldsymbol{x}′)〉$, where $\\phi$ is the Gaussian function. Therefore, the RBF kernel is defined as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "K\\left(\\boldsymbol{x}, \\boldsymbol{x}^{\\prime}\\right)=\\exp \\left(-\\frac{\\left\\|\\boldsymbol{x}-\\boldsymbol{x}^{\\prime}\\right\\|^2}{2 \\sigma^2}\\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where the parameter $\\sigma^2$ is the variance and gives shape to the Gaussian function. \n",
    "\n",
    "On the exercise you are given a ```featurizer``` which uses an ```RBFSampler```. The ```RBFSampler``` uses a Monte Carlo approximation of the RBF kernel and generates samples with the specified variance. The ```RBFSampler``` has been trained on a predefined dataset. Thus, the RBF kernel will map the state $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$ d to the distance to the trained dataset. Therefore, an input state will be transformed to as many features as samples $N$ are specified in the ```RBFSampler``` $\\phi : \\mathbb{R}^d \\mapsto \\mathbb{R}^N $. \n",
    "\n",
    "In a nutshell, the ```featurizer``` function maps low-dimensional states to a high-dimensional representation, which reveals properties that haven’t been shown in the original low-dimensional space, e.g., for the Cartpole environment, it maps the original four-dimensional states to a 230-dimensional vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.2 Sklearn RBF function<a id='2.2'></a>\n",
    "In this excercise, we use scikit-learn library to implement the RBF approximation by doing following steps:\n",

    "- RBFSampler: A RBF kernel will map feature into higher dimensions using random Fourier features.\n",
    "- FeatureUnion: Concatenates results of multiple transformer objects.\n",
